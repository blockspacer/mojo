  // |int_value| is an arbitrary integer value provided as part of the event.

  // - If the event was a signal sent by sigqueue(3), pthread_sigqueue(3), or
  //   the like, then this will be set to |si_value.sival_int| field of
  //   |siginfo_t|, which is the value passed by the userspace process that
  //   asked for the signal to be sent.
  //   SEE ALSO: |pid|, |uid|
  //
  // - If the event was a timer expiration, then this will be set to the
  //   number of timer events that were queued.
  //
  //   In other words, for timers |int_value >= 1|, and is greater than 1 only
  //   if the event::Manager is lagging.
  //
  // - If the event is a generic event, then this will be the value provided.

  // family of system calls. This field is only populated if the event was
  // caused by a SIGCHLD signal sent by the kernel.
  //

  // |pid| is a process ID associated with the event.
  //
  // - If the event was a signal sent by kill(2), sigqueue(3), or friends, then
  //   this is the process ID of the sender.
  //   SEE ALSO: |uid|, |int_value|
  //
  // - If the event was a SIGCHLD signal sent by the kernel, then this is the
  //   process ID of the child that exited.
  //   SEE ALSO: |uid|, |wait_status|
  //

  // |uid| is a user ID associated with the event.
  //
  // - If the event was a signal sent by kill(2), sigqueue(3), or friends, then
  //   this is the real user ID of the sender.
  //   SEE ALSO: |pid|, |int_value|
  //
  // - If the event was a SIGCHLD signal sent by the kernel, then this is the
  //   real user ID of the child that exited.
