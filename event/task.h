// A Task is used by asynchronous and/or threaded functions as an output
// parameter for returning a base::Result, with the side effect of notifying
// the caller of completion in the process. Task is commonly used in
// conjunction with an event::Manager.
//
// Task supports deadlines. Deadlines can be used to abort operations that get
// stuck waiting on a resource, e.g. because a networked host is down. Task
// deadlines are strictly advisory: the operation must check for them.
//
// Task also supports asynchronous cancellation: the caller can arrange for
// |Task::cancel()| to be called, and the asynchronous callee can observe this
// request and cancel the long-running operation.
//
// Compare and contrast with |std::future|: |std::future| supports arbitrary
// value types, but has no concept either of deadlines or of cancellation.
//
// THREAD SAFETY: This class is thread-safe.
